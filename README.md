# library_app

The briefest description of my cool project and why you should all use it.

## :computer: [Click here](#https://librar.onrender.com/library) to see my live project!

## :page_facing_up: About
The library app has the following functionalities:

- Users can view a collection of books in the library.
- Users can add new books to the library.
- Users can edit the details of existing books.
- Users can delete books from the library.
- Users can add comments to books and view existing comments.
```zsh
$ 
```
- home page


## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Defined the requirements and features of the library app
- Add screenshots/drawings of doodles/plans during the planning phase.
- Flow charts of app logic.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- Python Flask framework for the backend
- PostgreSQL database to store book, user and comment data
- HTML, CSS for frontend

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- admin page not done

## :sob: Lessons learnt
What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...
- organise the code better and push the code more often to track what I have changed.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this
- Search functionality to allow users to search for specific books.
- Sorting and filtering options for better book organization.
